# Reports

The Nocturne Reports section provides a comprehensive suite of diabetes management analytics and insights. Rather than displaying technical graph titles, we use an intent-based framework that organizes reports around user-focused questions and goals.

## Intent-Based Framework

Reports are organized into categories that answer specific questions people with diabetes actually ask:

### How Am I Doing?

**Get a comprehensive overview of your current diabetes management status**

- **Executive Summary**: HbA1c estimates, TIR, variability score, and management quality index
- **Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)**: 14-day glucose pattern overlay with percentile bands
- **Time in Range Analysis**: Detailed TIR breakdown with trend analysis and targets
- **Glucose Variability**: CV, MAGE, J-Index, and glycemic variability metrics

### What's Working?

**Identify successful patterns and effective treatment strategies**

- **Treatment Effectiveness**: Bolus timing, correction ratios, and treatment outcomes
- **Meal Response Analysis**: Pre/post meal patterns and optimal timing strategies
- **Exercise Impact**: Activity correlation with glucose control and patterns
- **Sleep Quality Correlation**: Sleep patterns impact on glucose control and variability

### Where Can I Improve?

**Discover patterns and areas for optimization in your management**

- **Pattern Recognition**: Hourly, daily, and weekly glucose pattern analysis
- **High Risk Periods**: Identify times of day with frequent highs or lows
- **Correction Optimization**: Analyze correction doses and suggest improvements
- **Dawn Phenomenon Analysis**: Early morning glucose rise patterns and mitigation
